# Recipes App

The Recipe app keeps track of all users recipes, ingredients, and inventory. It will allow them to save ingredients, keep track of what they have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what they have and what you are missing from a recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking the app allows usrs to make them public so anyone can access them.
